#### Last Recently Used Cache (LRU Cache)

This Python code defines a class LRU which implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which the least recently used entries are removed when the cache's limit has been reached.

Here's a breakdown of the methods in the LRU class:

__init__: This is the constructor method. It initializes the LRU cache with a given configuration.

__setattr__: This method is used to set the value of an attribute. If the attribute being set is 'count', it checks if the deck is full and sets the 'deck_full' flag accordingly.

__contains__: This method checks if a key is in the cache.

__len__: This method returns the number of items in the cache.

__delitem__: This method removes an item from the cache and the deck, and decrements the count.

__iter__: This method returns an iterator that allows you to iterate through the keys in the deck, starting with the most recently used key.

__getitem__: This method retrieves an item from the cache. If the key is found, it reorders the deck and returns the value. If the key is not found, it raises a KeyError.

__setitem__: This method adds an item to the cache. If the key already exists, it updates the value and reorders the deck. If the key does not exist, it adds the key to the deck and increments the count.

__create_empty_deck__: This method creates an empty deck with a maximum length and initializes the cache and count.

__get__: This method retrieves an item from the cache. If the key is not found, it returns a default value.

__split_deck__: This method splits the deck into two lists, the oldest and the newest keys. The oldest keys are returned, and the newest keys are kept in the deck.

__sync_make_ready__: This method removes the old keys from the deck and recreates the deck with the newest keys. It returns a dictionary of the old keys and their corresponding values.

This class can be used to manage a cache of items where the least recently used items are removed when the cache is full. It also provides methods to sync the cache with a database.
