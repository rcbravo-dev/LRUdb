### Last Recently Used Cache (LRU) with attached DataBase

The code is a Python class named LRUDataBase that implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache with a backing database. This class is designed to be used asynchronously, as indicated by the async keyword in many of its methods.

Here's a breakdown of the class and its methods:

__init__: This is the constructor method. It initializes the instance with a file name, a table name, and a configuration dictionary.

__aenter__ and __aexit__: These methods are used to make the class compatible with the async context manager protocol (async with statement). __aenter__ connects to the database and __aexit__ closes the connection.

__aiter__ and __anext__: These methods make the class an asynchronous iterable. The __anext__ method retrieves the next key from the database or the LRU cache.

__connect__: This method connects to the database and initializes the LRU cache.

__write__: This method writes a key-value pair to the LRU cache. If the cache is full, it offloads the oldest data to the database.

__read__: This method reads a value from the LRU cache or the database using a key. If the key is not found, it returns None.

__get__: This method retrieves the value of a key from the database or LRU cache. If the key is not found, it returns a default value.

__node_keys__: This method retrieves all the keys from the database.

__delete__: This method deletes a key-value pair from the database and the LRU cache.

__flush_cache__: This method flushes the LRU cache to the database.

__sync__: This method offloads old items from the LRU cache to the database.

__close__: This method flushes the cache to the database and closes the database connection.

__encode_key__, __decode_key__, __serialize__, __un_serialize__: These are helper methods for encoding and decoding keys, and serializing and unserializing values.

This class is useful when you want to cache the most recently used data in memory for quick access, but also want to persist all data in a database for long-term storage.
