### Asynchronous Database

The code is a Python class named AsyncDataBase that provides asynchronous interaction with a SQLite database. This class is designed to be used asynchronously, as indicated by the async keyword in many of its methods.

Here's a breakdown of the class and its methods:

__init__: This is the constructor method. It initializes the instance with a file name, a table name, and a database path.

__open_connection__: This method opens a connection to the SQLite database. It also sets the row factory to aiosqlite.Row which allows you to access rows by their column names.

__create__: This method creates a new table in the database if it doesn't already exist. The table has two columns: "node_id" (text) and "node" (blob).

__write__: This method writes values to the database. The values can be a tuple or list when inserting single key-value pairs, and a dict when inserting multiple key-value pairs.

__read__: This method reads values from the database using a node_id. The node_id can be a string, bytes, list, or tuple.

__node_keys__: This method retrieves all the node_ids from the database.

__delete_node__: This method deletes a node from the database using a node_id.

__close__: This method closes the cursor and the connection to the database.

__value_string__: This is a helper method that converts a dictionary into a list of tuples. It's used in the write method when inserting multiple key-value pairs into the database.

This class is useful when you want to interact with a SQLite database asynchronously. It provides methods for creating a table, writing to the table, reading from the table, retrieving all keys from the table, deleting a node from the table, and closing the connection to the database.
