### Functions and Classes

##### Running asyncio in Jupyter Notebooks
The `nest_asyncio` package is used in Python to allow running asyncio event loops within Jupyter notebooks or other environments that already have an event loop running. 

By default, asyncio event loops are not compatible with environments that already have an event loop running, such as Jupyter notebooks. This can cause issues when trying to use asyncio-based libraries or code within these environments.

The `nest_asyncio` package provides a workaround by allowing nested event loops. It patches the asyncio library to enable running asyncio event loops within environments that already have an event loop running. This allows you to use asyncio-based code and libraries seamlessly within Jupyter notebooks or similar environments.
